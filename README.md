# SVG Generator

## Description
This project is a demonstration of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts using JavaScript. It includes a library of shapes (`lib/shapes.js`) and an interactive command-line interface (`index.js`) that allows users to generate SVG files of different shapes.

## Features
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts using JavaScript
- Library of shapes (lib/shapes.js) with different shapes such as triangles, squares, and circles
- Interactive command-line interface (index.js) that allows users to generate SVG files of different shapes
- Testing using Jest framework

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript: The primary programming language used for implementing the object-oriented programming concepts and the shapes library.
- npm: The package manager used to manage project dependencies.
- Jest: The testing framework used to write and run tests for the shapes library.
- Inquirer.js: The library used for creating interactive command-line interfaces.

## Dependencies
The project dependencies are managed using npm. The following dependencies are used:

inquirer: Version 8.2.6
jest: Version 29.7.0
To install these dependencies, run the following command in your terminal: `npm install`

## Usage
To run the project, use the following command: `npm start`

This will start the interactive command-line interface, where you can choose a shape and generate an SVG file of that shape.

## Testing
To run the tests, use the following command: `npm test`

This will run the Jest test suite and display the test results.
